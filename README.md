# final-project

Project Milestone 1:
At this point in the project, I have compiled a list of considerably notable U.S. cities a college graduate (like myself) would consider moving to. This list consists of 59 different U.S. cities and excludes some states with no well-known, populated cities. I started recording the starting salary for an entry-level marketing position and the median income of each city listed. I plan on acquiring more data, like number of marketing jobs and size of the city, to incorporate as components in my visualization. 

I had hoped to have compiled all the necessary data points by now, but unfortunately it is still in the works. I do not anticipate this to take an extensive amount of time to finish gathering, considering the accessibility of this type of information. It was easier than I had imagined to gather this data and there were plenty of resources to offer what I needed. I plan on thinking of different ways I can show the relationship between the major components of each city and how it can ultimately determine the cities' ranking. 

Project Milestone 2:
I was able to compile a list of each cities' population from the 2021 census, so I will use this as a component for each city in the graph. I have not been able to achieve as much as I had anticipated due to time constraints, but I'm optimistic I will still be able to have my final version embody my vision.

I plan on plotting the data so viewers are able to draw a comparison between the median income and starting salary to visualize the differences in gaps between the two factors. I plan on drawing this distinction by manipulating the color, shape, or other aspects I find engaging. I will integrate the population statistics by manipulating the size of each data point so viewers are able to quickely correlate the size of the city to the size of the shape. I intend on adding other visually pleasing and engaging components, but I will have to explore my options along the way.
