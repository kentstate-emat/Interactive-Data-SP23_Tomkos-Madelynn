Project Milestone 1:
At this point in the project, I have compiled a list of considerably notable U.S. cities a college graduate (like myself) would consider moving to. This list consists of 59 different U.S. cities and excludes some states with no well-known, populated cities. I started recording the starting salary for an entry-level marketing position and the median income of each city listed. I plan on acquiring more data, like number of marketing jobs and size of the city, to incorporate as components in my visualization. 

I had hoped to have compiled all the necessary data points by now, but unfortunately it is still in the works. I do not anticipate this to take an extensive amount of time to finish gathering, considering the accessibility of this type of information. It was easier than I had imagined to gather this data and there were plenty of resources to offer what I needed. I plan on thinking of different ways I can show the relationship between the major components of each city and how it can ultimately determine the cities' ranking.
